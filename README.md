The dataset includes information such as the planet's name, mass, radius, distance from its host star, orbital period, and other physical characteristics. The dataset also includes information on the host star, such as its name, mass, and radius. The archive is updated regularly as new exoplanets are discovered, and it is a valuable resource for astronomers studying the properties and distribution of exoplanets in our galaxy.</br>
